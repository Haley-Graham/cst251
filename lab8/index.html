<h1>Lab 8: CSS Selectors</h1>
  <p>In this lab, I experimented more with css and with css sectors
    to change the appearance of my webpage.</p>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
  <p>This lab was not as intimidating since I now have some more
  experience with css, but it is still a little difficult to
  figure out how to achieve some results in css. I still have a lot to learn
  before it looks exactly the way I want it to.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>What you are seeing is an index.html styles with the index.css that
    I wrote the code for.</p>
