  <h1>~ Lab 16: Fancy CSS II ~</h1>
    <p>In this lab, we created an HTML and styled it with CSS coding. The only diffence this time is that we now have some more "fancy" css tools under oour belt. </p>

<div class="difficulties">
  <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>This lab was not very challenging compared to the past few labs we have been doing. We just experimented with the fancy CSS we learned in lecture.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>What you are seeing is an index.html styled with the index.css that
    I wrote the code for. </p>

  <h4>Ficus Lyrata</h4>
  <p>Thrives in bright indirect light. Can benefit from a few hours of full sun.Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Expect to water more
    often in brighter light and less often in lower light. Any humidity level will do.  Normal room humidity is fine, although leaves may burn if the air is too dry.This plant will
    reach an ultimate height of about 30’ (10m) and will have a spread of about 10” (3.2m). However, as a houseplant, will be much smaller.Fiddles are happiest in a stable environment
    and should always be placed right in or near a window. Keep away from air conditioners, heaters and drafts.</p>

  <h4>Monstera Deliciosa</h4>
  <p>Thrives in bright to medium indirect light. Not suited for intense, direct sun but can be acclimated to withstand it.Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings.
     Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower light. Monsteras can benefit from filtered water or leaving water out overnight before using. Normal room humidity will
      do, but prefers humid conditions if possible.It is an easy-going plant and is generally pest-free. Treat pests as soon as they appear with weekly sprays of horticultural (neem) oil
      and regular wipe-downs of the plant.</p>
