	<h1>Haley Graham</h1>
	<p> My name is Haley and I am a Communication Design major with a concentration
			in Visual Design. I'm currently living in Groveland, a small mountain town
			in the Sierra Foothills. I have a long-haired siamese cat named Appa, he's
			my baby. I am also a plant mom and am one of those people who bought way
			too many plants during quarantine. Other things I love to do include: thrifting,
			painting, kayaking, and going to concerts with friends.</p>
