  <h1>~ Lab 14: Typography II ~</h1>
    <p>In this lab, we had to replicate a website again by only using HTML and CSS coding. The only diffence this time is that we tried to challege ourselves more and chose a more difficult website to replicate.  </p>

<div id="difficulties">
  <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>This lab was not the most easy, yet not the most challenging. I only struggled positioning elements on the page, especially since it was in a resizable frame. </p>
