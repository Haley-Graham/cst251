	<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
	<p> The objective of this lab was to get even more experience creating an HTML, as well as practice inserting multiple images and adding links to them.</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>While completing this lab, I realized how much easier it was to complete than previous labs. Because of this practice I found mistakes much more quickly and with less stress. The only complication I came across while completing the lab was that
	I was missing the "< / a >" after the images that links. It was turning my next paragraph tag into a link as well, but I found the solution with ease.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>What you are seeing is an index.html that I wrote the code for. Below are images of my cat, Appa, with links to different cat resues in the Monterey Bay area.</p>
