<div id="objective">
  <h1>~ Lab 11: Advanced Block-level Styling ~</h1>
    <p>In this lab, I experimented more with css and used css sectors to change the appearance of my webpage.
      <br>I also used advanced block-level styling to postion blocks with certain properties.  </p>

  <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>This lab was not as intimidating since I now have some more experience with css. I found it a lot
      <br>less stressful, and had more fun designing this lab. I still have a lot to learn before it looks exactly
      <br>the way I want it to. I dedicated a little more time to style this lab in a more
      <br>organized and aesthetically pleasing way. </p>
