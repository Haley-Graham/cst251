	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
	<p>The objective for Lab 3 was to ensure an organized file structure for the rest of the course.</p>
	<p>Because the file structure was given to us, that step was a breeze. When it came to creating the index.html, was where I experienced some difficulties. At one point I added an extra ">",
		 it took me some time to find the mistake with my partner. I also realized it takes a moment to see the results on your browser, all I needed to fix that was a little patience.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>What you are seeing is an index.html that I wrote the code for. Below are my screenshots from Lab 3.</p>
