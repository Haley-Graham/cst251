  <h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements</h1>
    <p>In this lab, I experimented more with css and used css sectors
      to change the appearance of my webpage. </p>

<div id="difficulties">
  <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>This lab was not as intimidating since I now have some more  experience with css. I found it a lot less stressful,
      <br> and had more fun designing this lab. I still have a lot to learn
      before it looks exactly the way I want it to.</p>

<div id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>What you are seeing is an index.html styled with the index.css that
    I wrote the code for.</p>
